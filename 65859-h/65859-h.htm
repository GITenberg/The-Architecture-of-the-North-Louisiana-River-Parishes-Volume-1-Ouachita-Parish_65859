<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION...</span></h2>
<p>A most useful tool for understanding the culture
of a region is the study of its architecture. Buildings
in which people live, work, learn, and worship
reflect their tastes, economics status, and aspirations.
And it is through research of extant architecture
of an area that knowledge of past culture is
ascertained.</p>
<p>The Louisiana Tech University Department of
Architecture has received grants from the State
Division of Historic Preservation and the Division
of the Arts to conduct field surveys of various
parishes in North Louisiana. The purpose of the
surveys has been to ascertain the types, location
and quality of buildings 50 years or more in age.
The architecture students toured the highways and
back roads and photographed houses, outbuildings,
churches, schools and commercial buildings. They
interviewed occupants and area historians in search
of information concerning original builder/owners.
Each building was then documented, and the
compilation of documentation was cataloged by the
Louisiana Division of Historic Preservation in
Baton Rouge.</p>
<p>Each student was required to prepare eight pen
or pencil sketches of buildings of individual choice.
The original drawings, of which there are now over
1300, were placed in the William King Stubbs
Architectural Archives, the permanent collection of
North Louisiana architectural drawings at Louisiana
Tech University in Ruston.</p>
<p>The Ouachita Parish publication is the initial
volume of a series entitled &ldquo;The Architecture of the
North Louisiana River Parishes.&rdquo; The Ouachita
River divides the parish into two distinct regions,
the western portion being hilly country with the
eastern portion being flat river delta terrain.</p>
<p>Thus, a unique opportunity exists to study in one
parish various lifestyles and cultures as reflected in
historic architecture. Not only is there the rural
architecture of the western hills which contrast with
the rural architecture of the delta lands, but these
elements may be examined in relation to the urban
architecture of Monroe and West Monroe&mdash;The
Twin Cities on the Ouachita.</p>
<p>Following is the history of the settlement of the
parish and descriptions of the areas west of the
Ouachita, east of the Ouachita, and the urban
fabric of the Twin Cities. A <a href="#c32">catalog</a> of extant buildings
according to plan type and characteristic details
concludes the booklet.</p>
<p>So, join us now for a tour of the architecture of
Ouachita Parish.</p>

<h3 id="c4">18th AND 19TH CENTURY SETTLEMENT</h3>
<p>The area now identified as Ouachita Parish had
been occupied by aborigines since pre-historic
times. Early European explorers included DeSoto
(1542), La Salle (1682), and Bienville (1703). But it
remained for Don Juan Filhoil with a commission
from the Spanish governor to establish the first
permanent settlement on the banks of the Ouachita.
When Filhoil arrived in 1783, he named the site
for the outpost Prairie des Canots for the Indian
and trapper canoes gathered there. The military
post was later named Ft. Miro in honor of the
Spanish governor of Louisiana.</p>
<p>A colonization scheme formulated by the Spanish
government enticed the Marquis de Maison
Rouge to establish a settlement further north near
the conflux of the Ouachita River and Bayou
Bartholomew, the site of the present town of Sterlington.
But this settlement lost its position as a
rival for the seat of parish government after Filhoil
laid out a plot in 1811 for a town on his plantation
adjacent to Ft. Miro.</p>
<p>An exciting event occurred at the townsite in
May, 1819, one which was to have a two-fold effect
on the 400 inhabitants of Ft. Miro. The event was
the docking of the <i>James Monroe</i>, the first steamboat
to ply the Ouachita to this northerly point.</p>
<p>The ensuing excitement effected a village name
change to &ldquo;Monroe.&rdquo; And for nearly a century the
Ouachita River and steam powered boats combined
to form a great highway of commerce and
transportation for the region.</p>
<p>Overland transportation systems developed
throughout the territory during the 1800&rsquo;s. The
earlier Indian trails often became bridle paths. In
1839 a road was cut through from Monroe to
Vicksburg, but it was passable only in dry weather.
Stage coach service was initiated in 1849. During
this era a road was established westward through
the hills beyond the river; another went northward
toward Arkansas. These westerly roads later
became wagon roads bringing caravans of wagons
from Jackson and Claiborne Parishes to river trade
centers such as the former town of Trenton, two
miles north of the present town of West Monroe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
But it would be the advent of the Vicksburg to
Shreveport railroad in the 1880&rsquo;s which would
provide the communication link between the east
and west portions of the Ouachita Parish. In 1853
the state legislature granted the first charter for the
construction of the Vicksburg, Texas, and the Pacific
Railroad through North Louisiana. The first
passenger service from Vicksburg to Monroe was
in 1860. The tracks were destroyed by Union
forces in the Civil War but were reconstructed and
replaced in service by 1870. In 1882 the railroad
bridge spanning the Ouachita was opened. It contained
wood planking for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation. Rail passenger service from Monroe to
Shreveport commenced on July 10, 1884.</p>
<p>Ironically, the installation of the railroad service
initiated the demise of two regional institutions, the
town of Trenton on the west side of the river and
the steamboat industry. Trenton, which had been
platted into town lots in 1851, declined with the
location of the railroad two miles south. Cottonport,
a tiny community at the bridgehead on the
west side of the Ouachita, changed its name to
West Monroe and eventually developed into an
important business and industrial community.</p>
<p>Steamboat traffic on the Ouachita, which had
begun in 1819, yielded to the speed and flexibility of
railroad service. The glamorous steamboating era
of nearly a century of luxurious but sometimes
tragic travel came to an end in the 1910&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3 id="c5">20TH CENTURY DEVELOPMENT</h3>
<p>Thus, the parish of Ouachita, which had been
created in 1807 and which was subsequently divided
into nine parishes, entered the 20th century as a
rural agricultural region containing small urban
entities. Surrounding Monroe were large plantations
with cotton production as the major source of
wealth. But with the discovery of gas by Louis
Locke in 1916 in Morehouse Parish, the area
became known as the Monroe Gas Field, one of
the largest gas fields in the world at the time. With
this wealth came progress&mdash;paved streets, &ldquo;skyscrapers&rdquo;
and a salt water natatorium in the city of
Monroe. And the parish prospered as well. Industries
using available natural gas and paper mills
using yellow pine from the nearby hilly region
located in the area.</p>
<p>Transportation routes have continued to unite
the parish to the region and to the world. U.S.
Highway 80 was constructed in the 1930&rsquo;s as a
major east-west artery. Delta Air Lines began in
Monroe as a small cotton dusting operation. And
Interstate 20, completed in the 1960&rsquo;s, now serves
as an important coast-to-coast transportation route.</p>
<p>Ouachita Parish has been called the &ldquo;mother
parish&rdquo; of northeast Louisiana. It has contributed
much to the welfare of the region, and it continues
to offer the leadership of a pacemaker parish as the
twenty-first century approaches.</p>

<h3 id="c7">CONTRASTS ACROSS THE RIVER</h3>
<p>The rolling piney hill landscape of Ouachita
Parish west of the river contrasts with the delta
overflow land east of the river. This contrast was
reflected in settlement patterns with different land
allocations and building techniques. The delta
lands had been acquired by pioneers in the late
18th century and a plantation economy evolved.
The less productive western hilly area was settled in
the 19th century as small farm holdings. The eastern
lands were subject to river overflows; houses
were elevated and were generally of wood frame
construction. Pioneer houses west of the river were
often constructed of logs on wood or stone piers in
close proximity to the ground.</p>
<p>Thus, contrasting cultures existed on opposite
banks of the river. In this section the architecture
of the western bank will be explored through an
explanation of its extant architecture as evidenced
in housing, out-buildings, churches and commercial
buildings.</p>
<h3 id="c8">THE LOG HOUSE, 19TH CENTURY</h3>
<p>The early North Louisiana pioneers were more
concerned with the erection of a shelter for protection
from the elements and wildlife than they were
with architectural styles. Folk houses were constructed
of either horizontal logs or wood frame.</p>
<p>The typical log folk house plans of the mid 19th
century in the hilly country were the single pen
(room) wide and the dogtrot. The dogtrot plan
consisted of the two single pens (rooms) separated
by a floored and roofed but open walled space.
(The designation &ldquo;pen&rdquo; is used only in reference to
the rooms built of log construction).</p>
<p>Folk house plans constructed of wood frame
during the 19th century were the one room, two
room, saddlebag, dogtrot, central hall and later the
gable front and wing. These house types will be
examined subsequently.</p>
<p>Pictured on this page are examples of log construction.
In <a href="#fig4">figure 4</a> the logs were split; the inner
room wall surface would be even. In <a href="#fig5">figure 5</a> may
be seen several elements of folk log house construction
in the drawing of a house being dismantled.
This dogtrot with open passage between pens
had an attached porch, square logs with square
notches, an end exterior chimney (base visible),
three inch round pole roof rafters and gallery door
openings with the head occurring at the seventh
log. In <a href="#fig6">figure 6</a> a close-up detail shows the square
hewn logs and square notches on this dogtrot.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c9">THE WOOD FRAME HOUSE, 19TH CENTURY</h3>
<p>During the late 19th century and early 20th
century wood frame construction was used to build
high style and vernacular houses in the Greek
Revival and Queen Anne styles. <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> depicts a
late vernacular Greek Revival house with a symmetrical
plan, and <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a> shows a Queen Anne
house with asymmetrical plan.</p>
<p>The central hall plan in <a href="#fig7">figure 7</a> has a steep roof
with an integral gallery. Windows are six lights
over six lights. A wing was attached to the rear.
The original chimney is still visible.</p>
<p>The gable front and wing plan house in <a href="#fig8">figure 8</a>
was popular in the period from 1890 to 1920. The
key feature was the forward wing which occupied a
portion of the full gallery and the resultant half
porch. Often the front wall of the wing was angled,
or cut away, but the full roof gable remained. Or,
an additional polygonal bay was added. Note the
Queen Anne scroll and trim on the porch. This
replaced the simple 6&Prime; &times; 6&Prime; square post of older
house forms. This house plan sometimes featured
a central hall.</p>
<p>Though in a deteriorated state, the two room
house in <a href="#fig9">figure 9</a> has features worth noting. The
siding is vertical board and batten, a technique of
construction which appeared with the erection of
lumber and railroad worker housing in the 1880&rsquo;s.
The front covered area does not extend the full
width of the core; therefore, it is termed a &ldquo;porch&rdquo;
in contrast to the &ldquo;gallery&rdquo; of the previous two
examples. Also, it is &ldquo;attached&rdquo; and not &ldquo;integral&rdquo;
with the main core roof structure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<h3 id="c10">THE WOOD FRAME HOUSE, 20TH CENTURY</h3>
<p>The 20th century houses shown on this page
exhibit a quest for individuality and contemporary
expression. <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> depicts a typical central hall
plan. The roof is hip and not the usual gable. This
detail required a shorter gallery which was not
flush with the extreme end walls. The front door is
flanked by full width windows. Shutters were
added to the front gallery windows.</p>
<p>The bungalow plan appeared in North Louisiana
in the mid 1910&rsquo;s. This two room wide and two
or more room deep house type (<a href="#fig11">figure 11</a>) proliferated
in rural and urban areas. In its simplest form
there was a forward facing gable with a porch.
Here is depicted a half porch. Double windows
were used.</p>
<p>The 1930&rsquo;s house illustrated in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a> is
typical of the one room wide, several room deep
shotgun plan found throughout much of Louisiana.
This plan type became the typical house type for
workers in New Orleans after the Civil War. It was
seldom found in the hill parishes away from the
waterways. In the shotgun depicted in <a href="#fig12">figure 12</a>
plywood siding has been installed over the original
horizontal siding on the porch.</p>

</div>
<p>The small farms in the hill country were to a
large extent self-supporting. Certain elements,
such as food staples and clothing, were purchased
at area or regional stores. But the rural farmer
needed additional facilities to provide for his other
needs. Facilities were built on the farm separate
from the dwelling itself.</p>
<p>Farm outbuildings may be placed in two categories,
dwelling-related outbuildings and farm-related
outbuildings. Dwelling-related buildings were used
on a daily basis and included the well house, smoke
house, storage room, chicken house, privy, and
sometimes the storm shelter. Farm related buildings,
those necessary for agriculture and caring for
livestock, included barns (single crib, double crib,
transverse crib), storage buildings and often the
potato house, blacksmith shop and syrup mill.
&ldquo;Crib&rdquo; is a term used as a designation for room in
farm outbuildings.</p>
<p>The drawings on this page depict the nature of
the construction of farm outbuildings. They are
basic structures erected by the farmer and his
neighbors from available materials. Usually they
are in the rear of the dwelling. Style and quality
and finish of materials were not of great importance.
These buildings were altered as needed.</p>
<p>The largest outbuilding was the barn which was
used for the protection of horses and cattle and the
storage of wagons and farm equipment. The transverse
crib barn in <a href="#fig13">figure 13</a> included, in addition to
the log crib, an open wagon shed, a sealed storage
area and a loft for hay storage. Note the wood
shingle roof and combination of rough sawn horizontal
siding, logs, and vertical plank siding.</p>
<p>The small building in <a href="#fig14">figure 14</a> is similar in
design to a smoke house but was probably used for
animal shelter. The round logs have saddle notches
and no chinking between logs. Ventilation was thus
provided. The side addition gave storage area.</p>
<p>The clean, simple storage building in <a href="#fig15">figure 15</a>
was constructed of flush sawn siding with a raised
floor. The opening was for ventilation and light.
The side addition has a dirt floor.</p>

</div>
<p>The physical area required for the small farm
caused the dwellings to be dispersed among the
hills. One result was the existence of the lonely
farmstead and the extended neighborhoods.
Community feelings developed and interactions
occurred at places of meeting. These meetings
were both formal and casual. The formal occasions
would occur at the church, school, or in rare cases
the Masonic Lodge. Informal gatherings occurred
at the rural general store.</p>
<p>The predominant religions in the hilly country
west of the Ouachita were Baptist, Methodist, and
Presbyterian. Church services would be held on
Sunday. Some denominations would also have
weekly prayer services. Additional community
happenings were the annual graveyard clearing
with &ldquo;dinner on the ground&rdquo; and a revival. At these
events family and friends would discuss newsworthy
events. <a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a> is an example of the small rural
church which was built in the region.</p>
<p>The Masonic Lodge was once an important
community establishment. The Cadeville Lodge,
<a href="#fig17">figure 17</a>, is one of the few lodge buildings remaining
in North Louisiana. The first floor could be
used for public services or community meetings.
But the second floor was reserved for the private
functions of the lodge members.</p>
<p>The general store not only provided for the
physical needs of the rural inhabitants, but also it
contributed to their emotional well-being as well.
The store owner would stock his business by traveling
to distribution centers, often on the Ouachita
River, purchasing goods and selling them to area
residents. The regular weekly journey from the
farm to the store would be a time for sharing news
and discussing public events. Thus, supplied both
physically and emotionally, the family member, or
members, would return to the rural dwelling.</p>
<p>The general store shown in <a href="#fig18">figure 18</a> had a
porch for neighborly use, wide openings and a high
ceiling for ventilation, and it even featured a flag
pole in the front yard.</p>

<h3 id="c14">THE RIVER PLANTATION HOUSES, 19TH CENTURY</h3>
<p>The alluvial lands on the east side of the Ouachita
fostered a settlement pattern which contrasted
greatly with that of the hilly country west of the
river. Large holdings had been claimed during the
latter part of the 18th century and early 19th century.
The Ouachita River then was the only source
of regional transportation. Therefore, it was necessary
from a communication transportation aspect
that the land holdings possess headrights on the
river.</p>
<p>The resulting land holdings tended to have
narrow frontage but deep extent. Annual spring
overflows deposited silt near the river edge, and
this high bank was the obvious location for the
main buildings of the holding. Thus, the land also
determined the hierarchy of architectural development
on the holding.</p>
<p>This hierarchy of spaces on the plantation
followed a definite pattern. First, the river landing
provided an entry to the owner&rsquo;s house. Behind the
house would be the workers&rsquo; quarters, and beyond
these were the buildings necessary for the operation
of the plantation.</p>
<p>Pictured on this page are details of two plantation
houses typical of those which once lined the
east bank of the Ouachita. The 1838 Filhoil raised
cottage of <a href="#fig19">figure 19</a> has a Greek Revival portico
with fan light in the front gable, Doric columns and
a balustrade. The house was elevated for protection
from the river overflow.</p>
<p>The Whitehall Plantation house, <a href="#fig20">figure 20</a>, was
built in 1858. Greek Revival style details include
the squared transom and sidelights at the front
door, low roof pitch, and pedimented window trim
detail on the front gallery, <a href="#fig21">figure 21</a>. The gallery
siding was flush but beaded. The windows extended
to the floor allowing easy passage from interior
rooms to the gallery. Operable, slatted shutters
allowed sun control, ventilation, privacy.</p>
<p>Whitehall is a 1&frac12; story house with dormers,
attic rooms, and an integral gallery. These were
typical features for the Greek Revival cottages of
both North and South Louisiana. The central hall
plan is another characteristic of this type, which is
generally associated with American settlement.</p>

<p>The alluvial lands east of the Ouachita contained
two categories of dwellings, those of the
plantation owner as previously described and the
houses of the tenants and small land owners. The
dwellings depicted on these and subsequent pages
are typical of the latter category. The basic folk
house plan types used were the one room, two
room, shotgun and later the bungalow. Houses
were usually constructed of wood frame with vertical
board and batten siding or horizontal milled
siding.</p>
<p>A feature which the basic one room and two
room plan dwellings had in common was the integral
front gallery. The gallery roof framing was
part of the roof structure of the core of the dwelling.
One might notice in <a href="#fig22">figure 22</a> that although
two gallery columns are absent, the roof is still
standing.</p>
<p>The one room type is illustrated in figures <a href="#fig23">23</a>
and <a href="#fig24">24</a>. The front view of the circa 1920 house
shows a side addition to the original core room.
The side view, <a href="#fig24">figure 24</a>, shows that this was originally
two rooms deep since the space usually occupied
by the rear gallery was enclosed. The roof had
wood shingles on wood lath. The shingles were
later replaced with sheets of tin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The two room plan houses in figures <a href="#fig25">25</a> and <a href="#fig26">26</a>
were expanded as the space requirements of the
occupants increased. The first example has a rear
appendage. Vertical board and batten siding was
used on the addition, but an inconsistency in
window sash selection occurred. In <a href="#fig26">figure 26</a> the
appendage was built as a shed addition on the side.
This large two room house is two rooms in depth.
This additional depth allows the roof to be
higher, a definite advantage for the reduction of
summer heat.</p>

</div>
<p>The shotgun type house plan, <a href="#fig27">figure 27</a>, was
used abundantly on the river plantations. The
typical plan was one room wide and two or more
rooms deep. There were front and rear gables.
Variety occurred at the front gallery as evidenced
in the pair of shotguns illustrated. The gallery
might be the full width of the core allowing space
for chairs and thus creating an extra &ldquo;room&rdquo; for
relief from the summer heat of the interior rooms.
This gallery also provided a place for social interaction
between the occupants and passersby. In
contrast with this situation, the porch on the right
was of the width necessary only to protect the door
from the elements and to provide shelter for those
entering. As shown, shotgun houses were often in
close proximity to each other. This feature may
have had its background in the fact that the shotgun
plan had been used in urban situations in New
Orleans where property was extremely valuable.
However, when the plan was transported to a rural
situation, the close proximity characteristic remained.</p>

<h3 id="c16">THE 20TH CENTURY FARM BUNGALOW HOUSE</h3>
<p>As the 20th century advanced so did the plans
and techniques of constructing the folk house. The
bungalow plan was introduced into North Louisiana
circa 1915. This plan type was two rooms wide
and two or more rooms deep with front and rear
gables. The bungalow plan would continue to be a
popular house type in the region until the advent of
the ranch type plan after World War II.</p>
<p>The dwelling pictured in <a href="#fig28">figure 28</a> was typical of
the bungalow of the 1920&rsquo;s. As previously mentioned
in reference to the shotgun house, the type
of bungalow front gallery varied. The contrast may
be observed in figures <a href="#fig28">28</a> and <a href="#fig29">29</a>&mdash;the nearly full
width gallery with hipped roof and the half porch
with gable roof. An almost universal feature of the
bungalow house was the use of exposed rafter ends.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/p09.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="316" />

</div>
<p>It might appear that the occupant of the two
room house in <a href="#fig30">figure 30</a> desired to update his
dwelling to have contemporary characteristics
similar to those of the bungalow. The remaining
half porch was similar to those of many of the
bungalow houses. The currently popular double
window was used in lieu of the usual single opening.
And the rear extension created the multiple
room depth characteristic of the bungalow.</p>

<h3 id="c17">OUTBUILDINGS</h3>
<p>As was the case with the small farms west of the
river, so the plantations and farms east of the river
required outbuildings. Several examples of these
outbuildings are represented.</p>
<p>On this page are shown transverse crib barns;
the major openings occur on the end elevations. In
<a href="#fig31">figure 31</a> the typical transverse crib barn plan is
evident with the center aisle being flanked by
several cribs as shelter for stock. Above the opening
is a loft for hay storage. This drawing is also
descriptive of the landscape of the delta
plantation&mdash;broad level expanses of open land in
cultivation. Twentieth century communication
systems are evident with the dirt road and telephone
poles.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 31. Transverse crib barn in a delta landscape

</div>
<p>In figures <a href="#fig32">32</a> and <a href="#fig33">33</a> variations of the transverse
barn are illustrated. A barn with side shed additions,
vertical plank siding and loft storage would
have sheltered a wagon in the center aisle (<a href="#fig32">figure 32</a>).
A unique solution to the high water problem
is evident in the barn shown in <a href="#fig33">figure 33</a>. The
structure is raised and provides vehicle and stock
shelter in dry seasons, but any valuable equipment
could be removed as spring overflows inundated
the land.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c18">A LOG OUTBUILDING</h3>
<p>Log construction of outbuildings directly on the
ground was not a common model of construction in
the delta land. The obvious reason was that frequent
overflows would tend to produce rapid decay
of the wood members in contact with the soil. But
a rare exception to this practice was found in the
building illustrated in figures <a href="#fig34">34</a> and <a href="#fig35">35</a>. The relatively
tall log storage building has continuous
timbers as cantilever supports for side shed roofs.
Whether these sheds ever had vertical post supports
was not obvious on site inspection.</p>
<p>The corner wall detail, <a href="#fig35">figure 35</a>, indicates that
the large hewn timbers were assembled using half-dovetail
notches. The horizontal logs were so
closely cut that a minimum air space between logs
remained. Chinking material was not used to fill
these spaces.</p>

</div>
<p>A commercial establishment which was necessary
in the delta was the commissary. It served the
same function as the general store previously described
for the hill lands west of the river. The
commissary depicted in <a href="#fig36">figure 36</a> has double doors
flanked by large display windows. High windows
on the side walls provide light and cross ventilation.
This, too, would be a place for exchange of conversation
as well as purchase of goods.</p>
<p>The community church would serve the plantation
workers and their families. The buildings were
generally composed of one large assembly room
and classrooms as appendages to the main building.
A porch protected the double entry doors. A mark
of individuality might have been created in the
treatment of the belfry. The church illustrated in
<a href="#fig37">figure 37</a> has a single small belfry, but often twin
towers were constructed. In addition to this function
as a summons to worship, the bell was often
used as a community signal of momentous events
such as a birth or death on the plantation.</p>

<h3 id="c21">THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE TWIN CITIES</h3>
<p>Field research of the buildings of Ouachita
Parish has revealed that there are three distinct
characteristic types of architecture. In the western
hilly region of the parish is the small farm type, and
in the eastern river delta region the rural plantation
type prevailed. Both of these have been previously
described. The third category of architecture is the
urban type, found within the environs of Monroe
and West Monroe.</p>
<p>Whereas the rural architecture, with the exception
of the plantation owner&rsquo;s house, tended to be
utilitarian and unconcerned with stylistic trends, the
urban architecture very often was reflective of the
currently popular national architectural styles. The
styles most evident in extant residences in Monroe
and West Monroe include Greek Revival, Queen
Anne, Colonial Revival and California Bungalow.</p>
<p>Styles found in ecclesiastical, civic and commercial
buildings include Victorian Gothic and the
Classic Revivals of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Following is a sampling of the various folk and
styled architecture found within the city limits of
Monroe and West Monroe.</p>
<h3 id="c22">19TH CENTURY HOUSES ON THE RIVER</h3>
<p>The Greek Revival house pictured in <a href="#fig38">figure 38</a>
was built circa 1835 as the residence of the overseer
for Lower Pargoud Plantation. A companion
residence was constructed on the Upper Pargoud
Plantation and exists at the end of Island Drive in
Monroe.</p>

<p>Layton Castle, <a href="#fig39">figure 39</a>, was begun before 1820
as the residence of Judge Henry Bry. John James
Audubon was a guest in the home during his visits
to the wilderness of North Louisiana. In 1910 the
house was renovated to resemble a European
chateau.</p>

<p>The 1882 Cox house depicted in <a href="#fig40">figure 40</a> was
approached through an oak alley facing the road,
which later became South Grand Street. In the

<h3 id="c23">&ldquo;TURN OF THE CENTURY&rdquo; QUEEN ANNE HOUSES</h3>
<p>The popular circa 1890 through 1910 house
style, Queen Anne, had numerous identifying
features. A steeply pitched roof of irregular shape
often had a dominant front facing gable. Patterned
shingles, cutaway bay windows and various other
elements were used to avoid a smooth-walled
appearance. The facade was asymmetrical, and
often it had a partial or full width porch along a
side wall as well as on the front.</p>
<p>Queen Anne dwellings were also noted for their
decorative detailing. Delicately turned porch
columns and decorative spandrels with knob-like
beads were common. Spindle work was used on
railings, at porch ceilings, and under the roof
overhangs at cutaway bays.</p>
<p>The house in <a href="#fig41">figure 41</a> was constructed with
forward gables, a partial porch on the front and a
cutaway bay. Decorative elements include the
ornamented gables and a spindlework frieze
between the porch posts at the ceiling.</p>

</div>
<p>Houses built after 1900 with the characteristics
described as follows have been designated as being
Colonial Revival style. A basic characteristic feature
of this style was the accentuated front door
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
with a porch supported by slender columns. Doors
often had overhead fan or transom lights with sidelights,
and windows contained double hung sash
with multi-pane glazing in one or both sashes. As
the 20th century advanced, windows were grouped
in pairs of even units of three.</p>
<p>The Ernest L. Neville house on Hudson Lane,
Monroe, <a href="#fig43">figure 43</a>, was erected as a two story
house with a dominant front gable with a multi-paned
Palladian window, complete with keystone.
The half-porch is full height with a railed balcony
and Doric columns.</p>
<p>The circa 1914 James Harvey Trousdale house,
<a href="#fig44">figure 44</a>, on Hudson Lane is Colonial Revival in
detailing, but the dominant, nearly square, configuration
resembles that of a 19th century Louisiana
raised cottage. Note the full story height raised
basement area with the broad entrance steps.</p>

of the 20th century. The full two-story semicircular
porch with columns and pilasters has a balustrade
and broad dormer at the roofline. The front door
is accentuated with square transom and sidelights.
Note the elaborate expanse of entry steps at the
porch floor. Windows are glazed with multiple

the north of Monroe. They, along with the Governor
Hall house which follows, are examples of the

<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>The Governor Luther Hall Colonial Revival
home pictured in figures <a href="#fig47">47</a> and <a href="#fig48">48</a> was erected on
Jackson Street in the older section of Monroe circa
1906. It contains the characteristics of the style
previously described&mdash;accentuated front door with
full pedimented portico supported by slender
columns, fan light and sidelights and multi-panes
over single pane sashes. The Hall house also
contains elaborate detailing in addition to these
usual characteristics of the Colonial Revival style.</p>

<p>The detail drawing of the Governor Hall house,
<a href="#fig48">figure 48</a>, is illustrative of elaborate, nearly excessive,
detailing. The window not only possesses
pilaster trim with an entablature and pediment, but
also a design featuring interlocking segmental and
square panes in the upper sash. The entry door is
slightly recessed which allows space for three
segmented arches with keystones on Doric columns.
And, in addition, the balcony above is
supported by four curved fan-like wooden brackets.
Note the large scale column bases.</p>
<p>The Travis Oliver house at the north end of
Riverside Drive in <a href="#fig49">figure 49</a> is indicative of the
continued popularity of the Colonial Revival style
in the cities. Built circa 1930, this two story house,
similar to those previously described, has a full
porch with slender columns, a small balcony and
accentuated front door with an elliptical transom
and sidelights. But certain mutations make this
Colonial Revival house distinct from those previously
described. The lower front windows are
wood casement with a semicircular wood fan
above. Second story windows are large eight over
eight pane double-hung sash. Most importantly,
the house is of brick veneer construction. Those
previously described have horizontal wood siding.
The 1930&rsquo;s decade witnessed the apparent popularity
and desirability of the use of brick in preference
to wood as an exterior cladding material.</p>

<h3 id="c25">VARIOUS 20TH CENTURY HOUSE STYLES</h3>
<p>During the first three decades of the 20th
century, while the Colonial Revival houses were
being built in both one and two story versions,
other styles were being represented in the Twin
Cities. The Tudor Revival, Prairie Style and the
California Bungalow received widespread acceptance
in the 1920&rsquo;s and 1930&rsquo;s. One selection each
of the Tudor Revival and Prairie Style are illustrated
herein; also depicted is an example of a hybrid
Queen Anne-California Bungalow House.</p>
<p>The Tudor Revival style, popular in the United
States from 1890 to 1940, received only nominal
acceptance in North Louisiana. Characteristics
included a simple box plan with extensions, facade
dominated by two or more prominent cross gables
and windows in multiple groupings with multipane
glazing. Also used were massive chimneys with
chimney pots.</p>
<p>The Masur Museum on South Grand Street in
Monroe was constructed 1929 by Elmer Slagle, Sr.
Depicted in <a href="#fig50">figure 50</a> are the characteristics of the
Tudor Revival described above. This stone veneer
house has a mezzanine porch in the rear overlooking
a formal garden and the Ouachita River.</p>

Museum (Bldg. 152).</i></p>
</div>
<p>A Monroe landmark is the 1926 G. B. Cooley
house also on South Grand Street. See <a href="#fig51">figure 51</a>.
Designed by the architect Walter Burley Griffin, an
associate of Frank Lloyd Wright, the plan was laid
out to resemble the decks of a steamboat. Mr.
Cooley, the owner, was a steamboat captain who
plied the Ouachita for many years. The Prairie
Style house has 100 windows which may be opened
to take advantage of summer breezes.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 51. Cooley house designed in the Prairie Style
(Bldg. 153).</i></p>
</div>
<p>An interesting Trenton Street house in West
Monroe, <a href="#fig52">figure 52</a>, represents a mingling of stylistic
detailing. The gable has wood shingles similar to
those used in the Queen Anne styles, and the small
patterned window panes of that period are reused
in a new form. But the exposed rafter ends and
expansive overhangs are characteristics of the
California Bungalow style.</p>

<p>Thus, Monroe and West Monroe contain a
variety of residential stylistic expressions as evidenced
in the extant houses.</p>

<h3 id="c26">THE 20TH CENTURY CALIFORNIA BUNGALOW HOUSE</h3>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 54. An expressive West Monroe California
Bungalow (Bldg. 156).</i></p>
</div>
<p>An innovation in housing design and stylistic
detailing occurred in North Louisiana during the
second decade of the 20th century. The houses of
two California architects, Charles and Henry
Greene, led to the establishment of a style known
as &ldquo;Craftsman.&rdquo; Several influences&mdash;the English
Arts and Crafts movement, interest in oriental
wood architecture and training in the manual
arts&mdash;may have encouraged the Greene brothers to
design intricately detailed buildings. Their work
and other California residences received publicity
in the various national magazines. Thus, the one-story
Craftsman house soon became the most
popular and fashionable smaller house in the
country. In Louisiana these houses have been
labeled &ldquo;California Bungalows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The characteristic features occurred normally
on the facades, that portion of the house most visible
to the public. The low-pitched gabled roof had
wide, unenclosed eaves and overhangs and roof
rafters were exposed and decorative false beams or
braces occurred under the gables. Porches were
full or partial width across the front.</p>
<p>The porch or gallery columns had distinctive
detailing. Typically, short square upper columns
were placed over more massive masonry piers or a
solid porch balustrade (skirt). The columns, piers,
or balustrades often began at ground level and
extended with no interruption to a level above the
porch floor.</p>
<p>The California Bungalow style houses constitute
the most numerous group of extant styled houses in
the Twin Cities. As such, they represent a definite
attempt to establish a styled expression of individuality
for the houses of the general populace. The
examples illustrated on these pages are representative
of this style.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>In <a href="#fig53">figure 53</a> a California Bungalow in north
Monroe was built with the front gable expressed in
the broad three-windowed dormer. Note the
extensive dormer roof overhang. The full width
front gallery is provided with screens between the
straight full height wood columns; the gallery roof
overhang contains exposed rafter ends.</p>
<p>Another expression of the California Bungalow
appeared in the circa 1930 West Monroe house
shown in <a href="#fig54">figure 54</a>. This two story house has a
front gable and multiple groupings of windows.
But the greatest expression occurs in the one-story
gallery. It has a smaller low pitched gable roof with
four full height square brick piers and a half height
brick pier near the door. The balustrade continues
to the side porte cochere, or car shelter.</p>
<p>The freedom of design offered by the California
Bungalow style allowed a house form beyond that
of the standard simple rectangle, and the West
Monroe circa 1920 house in <a href="#fig55">figure 55</a> used this
freedom. The roof contains no gables, the front
porch is allowed to wrap around the side, and the
rear porch is enclosed providing additional room.
The exposed rafter ends support a rather deep
overhang. The porch supports are constructed of
massive wood posts on half height brick piers.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 55. A rambling California Bungalow on Trenton
St., West Monroe (Bldg. 157).</i></p>
</div>
<p>Yet another expression occurs in the West
Monroe circa 1926 house in <a href="#fig56">figure 56</a>. The high
roof allows space for attic rooms. Note shed roof
dormer.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 56. Another expression of the popular California

</div>
<p>The California Bungalow style continued to be
popular in the region until after World War II
when it was supplanted by the &ldquo;ranch&rdquo; form house
with a concrete slab floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h3 id="c27">A 20TH CENTURY COMPLEX&mdash;IN THE CITY</h3>
<p>When the J. E. Peters house and auxiliary buildings
were built in the late 1920&rsquo;s and 1930&rsquo;s, the site
was on the southern limits of the city of Monroe,
but it subsequently was included within the city
boundaries. Thus, today a unique rural atmosphere
exists within an urban context.</p>
<p>The complex depicted in figures <a href="#fig57">57</a> through <a href="#fig60">60</a>
contains a two story house, garage apartment,
storage or quarters building and a pair of water
storage tanks.</p>
<p>The two story house, <a href="#fig57">figure 57</a>, contains four
rooms over four rooms and a stair and bath facilities.
The one story gallery on the front and side
provides ample opportunity for relaxation and
relief from the heat of the interior rooms in the
summer. Note the absence of a chimney; winter
heating would have been provided by the newly
discovered natural gas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig57">
<img src="images/p15.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="488" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 57. The drawings on these pages are of the
same site in south Monroe, the Peters house
(Bldg. 126).</i></p>
</div>
<p>In the rear of the Peters house is a 1930&rsquo;s
garage apartment, <a href="#fig58">figure 58</a>. This element is a
unique feature in the history of urban residential
architecture. The automobile became obtainable
by the urban family during the second decade of
the 20th century, and it was sheltered in a structure
separate from the residence. The garage would
usually provide shelter for one to two automobiles.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig58">
<img src="images/p15a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="510" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 58. A garage apartment adjacent to the house.
(Bldg. 126).</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Often an apartment would be placed above the
garage, as shown. Note the exterior access stairway.
In post World War II residences the automobile
would be sheltered in a garage attached to the
main residence; subsequently this garage would
relinquish its walls and doors and be known as a
&ldquo;carport.&rdquo; Thus, the garage apartment holds a
unique place in America domestic architecture.</p>
<p>The Peters store house, or quarters, <a href="#fig59">figure 59</a>,
also was representative of the era described. This
building has exposed rafter ends, five panel doors,
milled (not brick) siding, and is raised three steps
above the ground.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig59">
<img src="images/p15c.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="491" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 59. The storage building in the rear (Bldg. 126).</i></p>
</div>
<p>The water towers shown in <a href="#fig60">figure 60</a> are elevated
to provide gravity pressure for water needed on
the farm complex, whether for irrigation or livestock
or domestic use. The towers are situated in a
grove of pecan trees.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig60">
<img src="images/p15d.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="428" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 60. Water tanks on the farm site (Bldg. 126).</i></p>
</div>
<p>As urbanization increased, the opportunity for
complexes such as this to survive decreased.
Holdings were subdivided into residential lots, and
the rural feeling and inherent privacy which it
provided yielded to an environment of urban
compactness. This is the price of progress as a city
expands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h3 id="c28">URBAN ECCLESIASTICAL</h3>
<p>A distinct contrast exists between the rural
ecclesiastical building and that of the urban area.
The urban congregations tended to require more
stylized edifices for worship. This may be apparent
in the examples illustrated herein.</p>
<p>The 1899 St. Matthews Roman Catholic Church
is an excellent example of the Gothic Revival style.
Characteristics of this style include the tower with
belfry and spire, the single or grouped pointed-arch
windows, the stepped buttresses and deeply recessed
openings and wooden doors. These characteristics
are evident in the church in <a href="#fig61">figure 61</a>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">
<img src="images/p16.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="779" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 61. The 1899 Gothic Revival St. Matthews
Church (Bldg. 159).</i></p>
</div>
<p>The Tabernacle Baptist Church on Beard
Street, Monroe, was a later version of a style conscious
church building. The opening is recessed
and has a round arch over the door. A vertical
accent was obtained by use of the small tower,
<a href="#fig62">figure 62</a>. Brick as an exterior wall finishing material
was commonly used in the towns; this contrasted
to the almost universal use of wood siding on
churches in the rural areas of the parish.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 62. Tabernacle Baptist Church on Beard

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h3 id="c29">EDUCATIONAL BUILDINGS</h3>
<p>There are a number of extant 50 year old
educational buildings in the Twin Cities which are
excellent examples of the various prevailing architectural
styles. The Mediterranean style is evident
in such elementary schools as Georgia Tucker, Lida
Benton, and Barksdale Faulk. Jacobean Revival
may be seen in the old Ouachita Parish High
School building on South Grand; Art Deco is
represented in Neville High School on Forsythe
Avenue, Monroe. It is very fortunate that these
buildings remain and are either still being utilized
as educational facilities or are being converted for
contemporary adaptive reuse, the latter being the
case in the South Grand building mentioned.</p>
<p>Georgia Tucker School, <a href="#fig63">figure 63</a>, was built in
1919 and named for Mrs. Georgia Tucker Stubbs, a
member of a pioneer Ouachita Parish family. Its
Mediterranean style features include monumentality,
solidity, use of low arches and imaginative
towers. It also employs a unique treatment of
terracotta in cast panels and columns capitals. One
might note the use of free standing decorative nonfunctional
columns on the front. The separate
entrances for grades one through three and grades
four through six are clearly defined.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig63">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 63. Georgia Tucker School, 1919 (Bldg.

</div>
<p>The Jacobean Revival style was used for the
Ouachita Parish High School building depicted in
<a href="#fig64">figure 64</a>. Built in the late 1920&rsquo;s, this three story
remnant of the high school complex displays
monumentality and elaborate detailing at the South
Grand Street entrance to the classroom building.
Quoins were used at masonry corners. The roof
parapet wall contains decorative penetrations and
projections as an expression of the method in which
the building relates to the skyline.</p>

<h3 id="c30">URBAN COMMERCIAL AND CIVIC BUILDINGS</h3>
<p>It has been previously illustrated that the urban
residential, ecclesiastical and educational buildings
were constructed to reflect current stylistic trends
more than their rural counterparts; a similar observation
might be made about commercial urban and
rural buildings. The urban commercial buildings
depicted on these two pages represent some of the
stylistic expressions of the Twin Cities from the
time of early settlement, the 1840&rsquo;s, to the period of
the oil boom, the 1930&rsquo;s. As such, they might be
viewed as a summary of commercial architecture in
the Twin Cities.</p>
<p>The Isaiah Garrett law office, <a href="#fig65">figure 65</a>, was
constructed in the 1840&rsquo;s. Its configuration is similar
to that of the small residence of the period, a
two room core with rear wing, chimneys on end
elevations, and an attached front gallery. This
building is now the Colonial Dames Museum.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig65">
<img src="images/p17.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="298" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 65. Isaiah Garrett law office, 1840&rsquo;s (Bldg.

</div>
<p>The two story commercial building shown in
<a href="#fig66">figure 66</a> was built in the 1890&rsquo;s on North Grand
Street. It contains large glass areas for display and
interior light, and the second floor contains arched
windows on the street facade but flat lintel windows
overlooking the river.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig66">
<img src="images/p17a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="322" />
<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 66. 1890&rsquo;s commercial building on North
Grand, Monroe (Bldg. 164).</i></p>
</div>
<p>T. M. Parker built a two story commercial building
on DeSiard Street in 1908, <a href="#fig67">figure 67</a>. This
building was used as a hotel for a long period.
There is a similarity in the manner in which the
roof lines of the buildings in figures <a href="#fig67">67</a> and <a href="#fig68">68</a> were
constructed, since both parapets have shaped and
raised center sections and projecting cornices.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig67">

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 67. The T. M. Parker Building on DeSiard
Street (Bldg. 165).</i></p>
</div>
<p>The West Monroe 1909 two story building
depicted in <a href="#fig68">figure 68</a> was built with similar characteristics
as those previously described, a large glass
area on ground floors and a masonry upper facade.
But this building contains other individualistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
features. The second floor opens onto a balcony
which overlooks the Ouachita River, and a very
elaborate cast stone lady&rsquo;s head is incorporated
into the pilaster on the left side of the front elevation.
A companion sculpture on the right pilaster
no longer exists. One might wonder if it were a
male or female likeness.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>Fig. 68. A West Monroe commercial building,

</div>
<p>Civic architecture is represented by the 1925
Ouachita Parish Courthouse, <a href="#fig69">figure 69</a>. Neoclassicism
was used to represent monumentality through
the application of engaged Ionic columns on the
major facades. Broad entry terraces and steps
heightened the drama of entry into the main floor.
The roofline contains a balustrade as an expression
of uniting the building with the skyline.</p>

</div>
<p>The Frances Hotel, <a href="#fig70">figure 70</a>, was constructed
in 1930 and named for Mrs. Frances McHenry,
wife of a founder of Delta Airlines. Its Art Deco
style has a pronounced verticality and linear quality.
This early Monroe skyscraper has elaborate
window and facade treatment on the first three
floors with minimal facade decoration on the hotel
room floors above. The building is crowned with
elaboration on the facades of the top floor. This
floor once contained a ballroom which overlooked
the city and the river. Arched windows with elaborate
projections above broke the skyline. And
above the roof was an enormous red beacon which
was visible for miles at night. The beacon no longer
is lighted.</p>

<p>The buildings pictured on these and the four
preceding pages are examples of the manner in
which the designers attempted to create aesthetically
pleasing architecture for both the distant and the
near-by viewer. Several have interesting rooflines
which integrate the built environment with the
skyline. They also contain elements which may be
viewed from a closer position as a person enters
the building; such elements include steps, entry
details, and intricate window trim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c31"><span class="small">CONCLUSION....</span></h2>
<p>Ouachita Parish possesses a rich architectural
heritage. In time, this heritage spans from the
beginnings of Layton Castle in the early 1800&rsquo;s to
the high rise Frances Hotel of the 1930&rsquo;s&mdash;and on
to the present. In terms of style, this heritage
includes the simple one room houses as well as
representatives of Greek Revival, Queen Anne,
Gothic Revival, Colonial Revival, Classic Revival,
California Bungalow, Prairie Style, Tudor Revival,
and Art Deco.</p>
<p>The life styles and cultures of the inhabitants
are reflected and expressed in this architectural
heritage. These cultures included that of the small
farms west of the river, the plantations east of the
river, and the urban culture as seen in the architecture
of Monroe and West Monroe. What a rich
assortment exists within a 20 mile radius of the
center of Ouachita Parish.</p>
<p>But this heritage is in danger. As progress
continues and prosperity grows, the architectural
heritage often diminishes. Older buildings are seen
as liabilities and become victims of the wrecking
ball. These buildings, whether constructed of log
or brick with Romanesque or Gothic details, will
not be erected again. Therefore, the visual insights
into past cultures which these older buildings
represent are lost forever.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the publication of this collection
of Ouachita Parish&rsquo;s architectural heritage will
make the public more aware of its valuable treasure
as evidenced in older architecture. And in turn,
it is hoped that this awareness will assist in the
preservation of vestiges of our traditional past.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
